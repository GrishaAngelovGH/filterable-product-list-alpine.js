# Filterable Product List | Alpine.js

Front-end project implemented in Alpine.js, providing visualization of filterable product list.
The user is able to search for products by name as search criteria.

The approach for this project was to create reusable 'components' similar to those in ReactJS.
For that reason `jsx-dom` is added as dependency.

Implemented features: 

* Visualization of categories with products
* Mark products out of stock in different color
* Search for product by name

## The front-end project is using the following technologies:
* Integrated **alpine.js 3.12.3**
* Integrated **bootstrap 5.3.0**
* Integrated **http-server 14.1.1**
* Integrated **webpack 5.88.1**
